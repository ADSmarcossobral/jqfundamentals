= Welcome to jQuery Fundamentals! =
Thanks for signing up for the jQuery Fundamentals class! In the interest of getting right to work when we meet, I've put together a few notes about things to do before the class. Your help in doing this housekeeping beforehand is much appreciated. 


== Setting up a Server ==
You'll need a server for the AJAX exercises we'll be doing in class, and you'll need to have it set up before you come to class so we can get right to work. You have a couple of options here:

 * Set up a server on your local machine, using tools such as MAMP or WAMP. If you're not familiar with these tools, they are fairly easy ways to get a server up and running on your computer, allowing you to access and modify all files locally.
 * Set up space on a hosted server, such as Dreamhost, MediaTemple, or similar, and access it via FTP or SSH.

If you have questions about how to do this, please don't hesitate to contact me.


== Getting the Code ==
The code we'll be using in class is hosted in a public repository on Github: 

http://github.com/rmurphey/jqfundamentals/tree/master

You can download a .zip or .tar file of the code, then uncompress it to use it on your server. (If you're git-inclined, then you can fork the repository instead, if you'd like.)


== Software ==
You'll want to have the following tools to make the most of the class:

 * The Firefox browser
 * The Firebug extension for Firefox
 * A plain text editor
 * An FTP or SSH client (if you're not using a local server)
