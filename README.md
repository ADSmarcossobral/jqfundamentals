# THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED

The content is now being maintained by the jQuery Project at [web-learn-jquery-com](https://github.com/jquery/web-learn-jquery-com).

Please see my [blog
post](http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/the-future-of-jquery-fundamentals-and-a-confe);
jQuery Fundamentals will be serving as the basis for a new jQuery learning site
maintained by the jQuery project, and ongoing maintenance and support for this
content will transfer to the jQuery project. 

# jQuery Fundamentals Training Material #

This repository contains evolving content to be used as teaching material for a
jQuery Fundamentals class, including exercises, solutions, and a web-based
book.

If you're looking for the latest release of the book, visit
<http://jqfundamentals.com/book/>.

## Using this Repository to Generate the HTML Book ##

For editing and collaborating purposes, the contents of jQuery Fundamentals is
broken into parts and chapters. If you would like to build an HTML version,
simply type `make` in your terminal or console in the root folder of the
project. If you are a windows user, you'll need either [GNU Make for
Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or
[cygwin](http://cygwin.com/). For example:

- Clone the jqfundamentals repository to your local machine<br>
`> git clone https://github.com/rmurphey/jqfundamentals.git`
- Change to the newly cloned repository's directory<br>
`> cd jqfundamentals`
- Make the book<br>
`> make`

This will create a folder called `/publish/` with the `index.html` file
contents of the `/book/include/` folder inside of it.
